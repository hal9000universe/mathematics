	\begin{exercise}[12345]
		Suppose \(V\) is a finite-dimensional vector space and \(U\) is a subspace of \(V\) such that \(\dim U = \dim V\). Prove that \(U = V\).
	\end{exercise}
	
	\begin{proof}
		Let \(B_U := (u_1, ..., u_n)\) be a basis of U. As a basis, \(B_U\) is linearly independent. Since \(\dim U = \dim V\), the length of \(B_U\) is the dimension of \(V\). It follows that \(B_U\) is, moreover, a basis of \(V\), because every linearly independent list of the right length is a basis for a finite-dimensional vector space.  
	\end{proof}
