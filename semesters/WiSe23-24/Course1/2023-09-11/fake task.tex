	\begin{exercise}[1212]
		Suppose $V$ and $W$ are finite-dimensional and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W)$. Show that with respect to each choice of bases of $V$ and $W$, the matrix of $T$ has at least $\dim \range T$ nonzero entries.
	\end{exercise}
	
	\begin{exercise}[1243]
		Suppose $D \in \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{P}_3(\R),\mathcal{P}_2(\R))$ is the differentiation map defined by $Dp = p'$. Find a basis of $\mathcal{P}_3(\R)$ and a basis of $\mathcal{P}_2(\R)$ such that the matrix of $D$ with respect to these bases is
		\begin{equation*}
			\begin{pmatrix}
				1 && 0 && 0 && 0 \\
				0 && 1 && 0 && 0 \\
				0 && 0 && 1 && 0 \\
			\end{pmatrix}.
		\end{equation*}

	\begin{exercise}[3471]
		Suppose $V$ and $W$ are finite-dimensional and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W)$. Prove that there exist a basis of $V$ and a basis of $W$ such that with respect to these bases, all entries of $\mathcal{M}(T)$ are $0$ except that the entries in row $j$, column $j$, equal $1$ for $1 \leq j \leq \dim \range T$.
